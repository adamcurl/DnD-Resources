    "The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors where uncivilized humans, orcs, and other foul creatures practice strange rites under the moonlight.",
    "The Marches are the homeland of the orcs and the birthplace of druids.",
    "The land is scarred by the Daelkyr War with twisted creatures and aberrations in the swamps.",
    "There are moonlit rituals to either summon or ward off fiends and scary monsters",
    "Many gateways to Xoriat are sealed here by the orc druids to keep this plane safe.",
    "The Marches remained isolated from the rest of Khorvaire until a few hundred years ago when House Sivis discovered the region contained valuable dragonshards and a number of human and half-orc clans that had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding, which led to the formation of House Tharashk.",
    "House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and their city of Zarash’ak is the center for commerce."
