Three thousand years ago, the first human colonists left, setting in motion events shaping modern-day Khorvaire. Sarlona was once split into over a dozen kingdoms, but some otherworldly force has united the nation into a single realm: the Empire of Riedra. Outsiders aren't welcome in Sarlona. It is said that Kalashtar and Inspired hail from this continent.",
