Tribes of barbarians roam the Seren Islands and the coastlines of Argonnessen; these include members of almost every humanoid race, perhaps collected by dragons in ages past. The Seren barbarians worship the dragons and protect the coasts from invaders. To date, no one from Khorvaire has ventured into the interior of the continent and returned to speak of it.",
