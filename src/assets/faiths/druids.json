  "practices": [
    "Ashbound: Defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.",
    "The Children of Winter: Believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.",
    "The Gatekeepers: One of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches. They act to protect Eberron from aberrations and other unnatural creatures and seek to prevent extraplanar incursions and attacks. The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.",
    "The Greensingers: Devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.",
    "The Wardens of the Wood: Believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they donâ€™t cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized."
